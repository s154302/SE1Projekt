# SE1Projekt

The zip file has two main folders:
 - scr 
 - test

The source folder, scr, has two packages:
 - code 
 - GUI

 The code package has the main program code: 
 Model, Activity, Employee, Project, TimeManager, NonProjectActivity and OperationNotAllowedException.
 The main code is done through the model.

 The GUI is our graphic user interface, where the class 'Drive' is running the whole program.
 The GUI makes a false data setup in the 'Frame' class, so one can get a feel for the program, 
 these data can therefor be removed when used in 'real' time.  

 The test folder has our tests for the program code.
